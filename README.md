### Supplementary material for Eva Reinhardt's Master's thesis: *Raccoon Behaviour Classification employing Machine Learning Algorithms using Tri-axial Accelerometer Data*

The Supplementary material includes the folders **maps**, **models**, **behaviour contingents** and **Scripts**. 

* **maps** contains a map for each free-roaming individual combining gps data with behaviour predictions. Data was provided by Carolin Scholz, Carolin Weh, Katherina Meyer. The behaviour predictions were obtained in the course of the master's thesis.
* **models** contains the used and trained models for the simple model option as well as for the layered model option.
* **behaviour budgets** contains hourly behaviour budgets averaged per month per individual from the above mentioned data sets.
* **Scripts** contains the scripts written and used in the course of this project.
